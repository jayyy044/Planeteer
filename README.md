# Planeteer: Rooting Out Crop Disease

### Goal

Agriculture is a race against time. For a farmer, a single 'off-looking' leaf can be the precursor to a field-wide disaster. In the heat of a routine check-up, uncertainty is the enemy.

We built Planeteer to replace that uncertainty with instant, actionable intelligence. Instead of waiting days for a lab result, a farmer can simply snap a photo. Our platform identifies the specific disease, assesses the transmission risk to surrounding crops, and provides clear, data-driven next steps.

We wanted to put a plant pathologist in every farmer's pocket.
